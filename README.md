# Intermezzo

Intermezzo is an online platform for users to buy and sell luxury brand items, such as Louis Vuitton, Versace, Polo Ralph Lauren, etc. In addition to being an online trading platform, the site also provides a space for both buyers and sellers to write blogs, interact with one another via direct messages and share the latest news in the fashion world.

## Documentation

The Problem:

Over the past few years, the market for luxury goods online has been steadily growing, with traditional brands setting up their own online stores. Owing to their quality, luxury brands tend to last a long time and retain their value. Accordingly, their is also a thriving informal market for secondhand luxury goods online. Platforms catering to this secondary market, however, are decidedly scarce, with only a couple of dedicated sites providing a basic platform for people to buy and sell secondhand luxury brands, and little more.

The Solution:

A platform for users to buy and sell secondhand luxury goods, as well as interact with one another via direct messages and a personal profile and blog that allows users to share their fashion interests.
